1 cleanup: why do I need bitmap, hash AND tree, can I get rid of bitmap and hash?
2 add exit events
  how to store async events, what to do during cache flush, extra listener thread??? locking...

- add process only view

- used cpu freq scaled values

- check if IO needs to include blkio beside char io

- fix seconds default if milliseconds option is set without seconds

- use CONNECTOR or GENERIC?
  -> Michael uses GENERIC like taskstat example, can get taskstat data per pid
  -> fork and exit events are only available from CONNECTOR (process events)
  -> need both...

- account exiting processes
  -> is taskstat data included in connector exit event???
	-> no    
	-> exit events still possible lost? test...
	   -> implement exit accounting

- PID vs. TID vs. TGID in code, use only tid/tgid ?

- check getline result didnt realloc buf, otherwise my ptr will be broken...

- handle potential variable procsfs cpu stat output...

- get USER_HZ and use it

- report wrong RSS value documentation

- find out how to re-enable netlink after nonfatal error

- sync option (after each cycle if file output is used...)

- create a pinned listener per CPU (to avoid migration and ease buffer overflow issues)

- signal handler for interruption cleanup

- store comm string in hash object and compare with taskstat comm, update if needed

Performance:
- get bitmap contents word wise or remove bitmap for hash only?
