nlmon - netlink based task monitor
-----------------------------------

Features:
- netlink based (lower overhead compared to procfs based tools, complete accounting over also for short-lived threads)
- thread reporting only
- output modes: text, csv, ncurses
- reports: cputimes, iotimes, RSS, cpudelay, iodelay

Required kernel configuration options:
CONFIG_CONNECTOR
CONFIG_PROC_EVENTS
CONFIG_TASKSTATS
CONFIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT
CONFIG_TASK_XACCT
CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING

Not supported features:
- CPU hotplug and freqency changing

The very first  "cpu" line aggregates the  numbers in all  of the other "cpuN"
lines.  These numbers identify the amount of time the CPU has spent performing
different kinds of work.  Time units are in USER_HZ (typically hundredths of a
second).  The meanings of the columns are as follows, from left to right:

- user: normal processes executing in user mode
- nice: niced processes executing in user mode
- system: processes executing in kernel mode
- idle: twiddling thumbs
- iowait: waiting for I/O to complete
- irq: servicing interrupts
- softirq: servicing softirqs
- steal: involuntary wait
- guest: running a normal guest
- guest_nice: running a niced guest

Running as non-root
===================

One option is to make the binary setuid but be aware that this also requires the binary to belong to root.
In other words only setting the setuid bit is not sufficient.
